MATLAB based OCT-Angiography based Automatic Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) and Vessel (Noncapillary and Capillary) Density Calculator

This software automatically calculates foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and vessel (noncapillary and capillary) density in different areas in OCT-Angiography images of the retina. It uses ImageJ *.roi files and *.jpg images as input file formats. It gives excel files (*.xls) and *.png images as output file formats.

Image size = 6 mm x 6 mm
OCT-A modalities = Full-Slab, Deep and Superficial  
ROI Types = Point Selection for Center of Fovea and Freehand Region Selection for Foveal Avascular Zone
IMPORTANT NOTE: Other types of *.roi files will be not identified by the software.
